				<blockquote>«I never met a Digital Project Manager as Agathe throughout my career. During these two years at ING Direct she was responsible for the management and the performance of the website www.ingdirect.fr.
				In addition to the continuous optimization of our website, she allowed us to redesign it.
				Thanks to her we managed this hard work responsive website creation and we got the best rating Google Mobile Friendly French banks (historical banks and online banks) before the mobile banking pure players.
				Agathe has a remarkable profile of Digital Project Manager : she is passionate about UX, Design and technical challenges.
				Also without being perfectionist, she has high quality level requirements. She is both creative and organized and she knows how to lead a team to carry out a project.
				She is honest and direct, she takes responsibility for eventual mistakes and adapts very easily to the team, the service or the company where she works.
				She has a good character. »</blockquote>

				<hr>
				<blockquote>« Agathe is a person that I totaly trust. She has skills in almost all digital needs you could have. If she doesn't, she loves to learn and does it fast. She is very organized and determined. When she starts something, she finishes it, no matter the hurdles she''ll meet on her way. Did I mention that she has a good spirit, she's nice and funny? If you need a partner to work with, stop searching around, you've just found it!»</blockquote>
